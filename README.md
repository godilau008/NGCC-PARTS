# NGCC-PARTS.STL
This is a collection of Nintendo Gamecube Controller parts meant to replicate to the best of my ability the original OEM parts. More will be added in the future with the main objective being a good T3 stick box replacement.

These models have not been tested yet as I do not own a 3d printer capable of printing pieces at such a small scale. If you like the idea and want to help me make these parts better, feel free to print them with something more precise than an FDM 3d printer if you have one on hand and send me feedback at my discord (Kermit#4438).
