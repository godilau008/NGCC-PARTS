# NGCC-PARTS
This is a collection of Nintendo Gamecube Controller parts meant to replicate to the best of my ability the original OEM parts. More will be added in the future with the main objective being a good T3 stick box replacement.

## Known issues
T3-NGCC-BOTTOM_HOUSING
- Clips for the top housing are too small
- Spring groove could be slightly deeper
- Hole circumference in the middle needs to be bigger
- Stab does not clip in (could be caused by plastic flex
- Bottom housing does not clip to the top housing (could be caused by the first issues or plastic flex)

T3-NGCC-GUIDE_X
- Gap for the stem is slightly too big
- Needs to be slightly higher (circumference might be too small)

T3-NGCC-GUIDE_Y
- Gap for the stem is slightly too big
- Causes lots of friction on the Y axis. May either be a bad print or bad tolerances.

T3-NGCC-STAB
- Fits poorly in the bottom housing (could be caused by plastic flex)

T3-NGCC-STEM
- Axis ball is too small
- Height is slightly off (probably because of the first issue)

T3-NGCC-TOP_HOUSING
- No sample on hand
